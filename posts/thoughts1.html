        <h2>Alternate title: help I'm fucking bored by early chapters in books</h2>
        <p><b>A "brief" note about this week's (it'll be the 6/11 one) summary:</b> I'm starting work on the TIT part early, specifically D&F, due to a strong lack of
        motivation to do things I already feel like I've spent a good amount of time on in the past. In trying to do the problems, I find 
        that I don't really need to prove group axioms for some set or another for the n'th time, and in trying to force myself I end up 
        accomplishing nothing but frustration. In order to maintain accountability for Chapter 1 of D&F I've decided to do the following:
        <ol>
            <li>The first metric of my actual comprehension of the material is <b>my ability to communicate it</b>. With this in mind, my hope is that by
                focusing on synthesizing the material in a coherent form right away (as opposed to slogging through notes I've essentially already 
                taken) I can then compare what I come up with to the textbook to identify areas of weakness and/or straight-up lack of comprehension.
            </li>
            <li>The second applicable metric is <b>my ability to do problems</b>. A quick google search turned <a href="http://math.stanford.edu/~akshay/math120.html">this</a> 
                up; I'll treat them as actual homeworks and post my solutions here. Trying to pick which ones to do on my own led to ambivalence and 
                indeciveness; no reason to put in that effort when someone already has so I think following an existing homework structure provides the accountability 
                and organization that I need.
            </li>
        </ol>
        </p>

        <p>
        As I wrote this I realized two things: 1) I think I accidentally stumbled upon a solid way of measuring comprehension in math. Definitely nothing 
        novel in the grand scheme of things, but arriving at the conclusion myself makes it more valuable. And 2) I should post homework solutions.
        </p>

        <p>
        <em>Weasiling this in on Wednesday</em>, but it's important to acknowledge that one of these metrics is definitely easier to apply than the others.
        Personally, I have a much easier time (and much more fun) synthesizing something I know and trying to explain it than going gung ho and doing actual 
        problems. Both metrics are equally important and should be treated as such with the appropriate balance.
