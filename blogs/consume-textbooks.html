        <h2>How to consume textbooks</h2>
        
        <p>First a note on how I'll organize this. I'm sitting here in the library on June 3rd after a shitty day of analysis paralysis yesterday.
            I'm going to do my research now to try and prepare for <a href="">TIT</a>, but I will also most definitely learn things and change opinions
            along the way. With this in mind my plan will be to 
            <ol>
                <li>Research now and condense informations/notes here</li>
                <li>Apply to TIT</li>
                <li>Discuss validity and effectiveness of starting research in blogs n logs</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>This will also take the form of dated updates to this page so that this can still be a self-contained resource on how to read textbooks.</li>
                </ul>
            </ol>
        </p>
