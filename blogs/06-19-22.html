        <div id="general">
            <p>Kinda late on Sunday but I'm not giving in and doing this on Monday. A bit of a scuffed log this week due to a 3.5 day vacation 
                but a log nonetheless.
            </p>

            <p>
                The only productivity I was able to get in this week was early in the week and even then it was just characterized by frustration.
                The main source of said frustration was: <b>The Problem of Problems</b>. The main thing is that I'm considering a slight shift to mostly focusing on reading for TIT.
                As it stands I've been trying to balance reading with "assigned problems" from syllabi I've found online following the books.
                I should say that after bringing this up in the math server, it's at least reassuring to know that getting stumped by early chapter problems 
                and having them take an eternity is definitely normal, unless you're absolutely cracked at something (I'm not (yet)). On the one hand,
                consuming new knowledge and trying to assimilate it with what I already know is easier than doing problems. By that I mean it's something I have 
                an easier time directing my full attention at for an extended period of time. It feels more fun and engaging, and I have an easier time <b>sustaining</b>
                focus. When I do problems I tend to get distracted much more easily and give up/ask for help before I've given myself a proper chance (and enough time) 
                to give a problem a true attempt. My desire to focus on reading stems from a pull to comfortable reading and a push from uncomfortable problems. 
            </p>
            <p> 
                <b>Am I then, in essence, bitching out?</b> I could make an argument to myself for both sides but I suppose if I'm asking myself the question in the first 
                place I know the answer is probably yes and I'm just looking for ways around it. <em>But then how do I reconcile these problematic problems?</em>
                In retrospect I did spend the meta part of this attempt at Ultralearning (more on that in <a href="../books.html">books</a> at some point) on how to read a textbook.
                And thinking about <a href="https://youtu.be/6z1JwZbX4dQ">Po Shen Loh's talk with Lex Fridman</a>, problem solving is its own skill with its own learning curve.
                My rationale for embarking upon any of this has been "learning how to consume a textbook", but a subtask of that is inevitably "learning how to do problems". 
            </p>
            <p>
                Following that rabbithole a bit more, the question then becomes if that's something I can even drill away (and how to do it in such a way that I can/will commit).
                So the question is <b>how much does solving one kind of problem in one subject transfer to solving a problem elsewhere?</b> I could "easily" decide to 
                attack some IMO questions and then end up with nothing to show for it... what I want is a habit/task that guarantees me to "at least learn ____ by the end". 
                And I want to do so in such a way that at least minimizes the helpless and debilitating feeling of not having done anything after 3 hours of the same task 
                (whether it's a problem or anything really). Yes, remembering that I do have clear motives as to <em>why</em> any of this is happening and yes, pushing through
                motivation droughts does practice the skill of commitment even on the bad days, and yes, I understand the change and improvement I'm seeking in myself 
                comes at the inevitable cost of that now-tiring word: frustration. But simply knowing and understanding these things leaves me very short of who I want to be.
                It takes a really specific sequence of choices, a sequence where at each decisive moment when I have the choice of doing something that contributes to that desire or
                playing Elden Ring, I make the right choice.
            </p>
            <img src="../images/fire.png" class = "text-img">
            <p style="font-size:small;">I'm still obv gonna play Elden Ring, that shit is just one of the greatest games ever made, full stop. Keeping it to between 7pm and 11pm is
                only reasonable though, if I've actually earned some time in the Lands Between from having used my day wisely, that should be more than enough for me To
                 enjoy without feeling guilty of "I could be doing shit I didn't do this morning." Also as silly as it is that I have to say this I'll do so anyways: it's not a habit 
                 set in stone!! Do other shit!! Leisure can also be a different book or just going out for a walk!! Leisure besides this time-sink of a game isn't "time I could've 
                 spent levelling strength", it's time still used wisely - and a decisive moment taken advantage of.
