            <p>A bit of a slower week this time around. I didn't do as many questions as I did last time but I think that was due to a lack of tangible planning. As in,
                last week I set <b>dates</b> and scheduled when I wanted to have a certain number of questions potentially answered but I didn't leverage that as much this week.
                Stupid ass Flappy Bitch is done too, got super annoying towards the end but I think it served it's purpose of getting me reacquainted with SDL and just programming a 
                bit more for the sake of it. GMTK jam was this weekend and although I didn't <em>fully</em> participate, I did at least get a fun game idea that is maybe
                just a wee bit out of scope - but that's what I need, to push a little bit so it's a good thing. I also just really liked the intensity I felled for the first bit, 
                I honestly miss that kind of time crunch and it was enough of a taste to make me want to do it again. In any case, my excuse this weekend was most definitely worth it 
                so I have no regerts :) can I have negative regerts? I guess that's just being happy with my weekend but I liked negative regerts more.
            </p>
            <p>
                Also two important thoughts from this past week: something as simple as saying, or even thinking to myself "I will get to work immediately" as I'm walking to the library 
                (or any study spot) saves a surprising amount of time. It's a little silly but it has helped me avoid those 30 minutes of procrastination that usually happen before I study 
                as I think "yeah just a video or two and I'll get to work" and end up wasting a lot of time. Similarly, having a predetermined time to leave was also good for two reasons: 1) 
                if I get the urge to leave early (and before I've gotten a justifiable amount of "work" done) then that internal voice can hop in and remind me of the leaving time and 2) (in theory,
                this isn't what I was thinking when I planned on writing this but it just occurred to me) if I'm procrastinating it'll kick me into action since I have a finite amount of time left to study.

                Some math specific stuff - what I've been doing with Munkres has definitely been positive but it occurred to me this week: my motivation of learning how to learn 
                (from a textbook in particular) is most definitely valid but I'm trying on <em>something I'm going to learn anyways</em> (via my topology class next semester). This 
                means that at the end of the year, once the class is done I'll essentially have the same level of knowledge/understanding as if I had done nothing this summer.
                I don't want this to be the case; in this spirit I want to try and expose myself (at least at a surface level) to some higher levels of math, the end goal being to <b>at least</b>
                know what X is about or what Y is used for. I'm not entirely sure where to start or how to go about it so I'll use this week to experiment a bit. Honestly, math server channels 
                might be a good outline? It's a start at least. 
            </p>

                <img  src="../images/outline.png" style="margin-right: 12px; width:540px; height:540px;">
                <p>Of this list I have some understanding of Algebra, Topology (building it), and a mild amount of Real Analysis. An idea to get familiar is textbook appendices. An entire book is 
                    not a good idea for what I want to get out of this kind of exposure. Besides that though all I really have are potentially lectures and youtube videos. We'll see....<p>

                I did the thing! On Wednesday I woke up at around 6 in the A.M. and biked my ass to the wall to hit for about an hour. Proud of that and I most definitely wanna replicate that.
                Honestly there's no reason why I shouldn't be able to wake up that early most days, it's just a matter of actually sticking to a sleep routine. Besides that I'm also throwing 
                weights into my workouts here and there too - I'm kinda flailing around in the dark trying to actually plan things out properly (what to work on, when, and for how much) but doing 
                something is better than nothing so I'll keep trying until I discover a good routine for myself.

                I'll have a full set of questions up to the end of Chapter 2 by this week...

                I played a bit of <em>Furi</em> the other day and I was thinking about something I head in a Joseph Anderson video about <em>Sekiro</em>'s combat; I actually had a lot of fun 
                <em>re</em>learning the mechanics of the fights because it forces you to be reactive to the fight and figure shit out on the fly, as opposed to algorithmic since you know "The Chain will 
                attack this many times and then I can attack him."
