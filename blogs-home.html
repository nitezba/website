    <!-- do i wanna make weekly summaries of EVERYTHING i learn in a week or only of the algebra? -->

    <body>
        <p><b>Wait I thought you actually had something to say, why are bolded questions being put in my mouth as an excuse for you to talk more?</b> 
            Shut up, starting on June 4th, 2022, I will be posting weekly summary logs of what I've learned (or 
            for some weeks, just how I've been productive). <b>Why?</b> Accountability and urgency. My hope is that by committing 
            to this weekly schedule, during the week it'll put pressure on me to put work into <em>tangible</em> things, and prevent
            me from fooling myself into thinking I've been productive. Honest self-reflection is the best sort of accountability. Also the staggered recall is nice.
            Oh and one more thing, the weekly logs will also help me update a long term plan week to week as I can evaluate my own progess through stuff (and replan accordingly). 
            <b>Okay <em>nerd</em> that's cool and all but what are you even studying? What are you supposed to be held accountable against?</b>
            This will change depending on whether I'm working, in school, or just kinda existing. At the moment, I'm
            <ul>
                <li>Planning out <em>two Textbooks In Two months</em> (TIT) (please laugh)</li>
                <li>Developing and organizing this website</li>
            </ul>
            
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Wait so will I still be getting juicy blogs without having to read your self-indulgent shit?</b> Yes! Every once in a while, if/when I go down rabbitholes or find somehting I 
            would otherwise be too lazy to investigate in spite of finding it very interesting <em>*cough*</em>, summarizing thoughts and notes
            into a coherent blog will be my way of 1) proving to myself that I've learned the material and 2) documenting what I've learned for future me.
            <b>Okay cool, now I, the shitty user of this shitty website, can get on with my shitty day!</b>
