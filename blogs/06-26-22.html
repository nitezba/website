            <p>    
                I am moving very slow. If last week was an exception because I was on vacation for most of it, this week I just had no excuse. I somewhat lazily 
                opted to just focus on Munkres and although this had some good side-effects (I've been reading a lot more) it's also just straight up not what I planned.
                But let's be positive first, because I do feel like I accomplished some tangible things this week.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is a little dumb to say out loud but I feel like I proved to myself that I'm capable of enjoying problems, and importantly, being intense
                about doing them. I realized that right now, I have the rare benefit of time, so I actually have the leniency to spend the time on problems,
                I'm using to being productive on a Pomodoro timer but doing problems on that kind of a countdown adds a different kind of pressure to "get shit done 
                before time is up" that honestly just ends up being distracting. I found that I'd rather just sit and do, period. I also kinda naturally ended up reading 
                further ahead than the chapter I'm doing problems for and I think that's a good thing. Not only does it keep things interesting but it forces free recall 
                and makes me fill in gaps I won't have noticed otherwise. About posting those problems though... they're long and I'm still slow. Not hard long, moreso tedious
                long, and that combined with me thinking too hard sometimes and nitpicking over proof details (happened multiple times this week), I didn't push far. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I do think I came up with a useful system though:
                <ol>
                    <li>Preread - read everything in the chapter but don't worry at all about retention; instead just take notes in the form of questions. Ideally,
                        these will serve as an evaluation/feedback method once the material isn't in immediate memory but I didn't test that this week.
                    </li>
                    <li>Free recall reading - the kind of reading I was trying to employ before: read a page or two (or until stopping point) close book and take notes 
                        from memory, as though you were trying to teach the material immediately.
                    </li>
                    <li>Switch - to (assigned) problems from previous chapters, preferably away from technology and just on a printed sheet of paper.</li>
                    <li>wait for it...</li>
                    <li>Self-test - at the end of study sesh, review questionss written in that first preread.</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            <p>
                Neato! I'm feeling a little down on the fact that I'm actually so short on progress in the book but these takeaways are at least comfort that I 
                haven't entirely wasted my time. I definitely have wasted some of it though, and again, some days this week were proof to myself that I am capable of being 
                as intense about this as I really want to be; that I won't let short-term immediate rewards get in the way.
            </p>

                TOMORROW: I will read about Axiom of Choice and Zorn's Lemma. At this point I can blackbox the set theory stuff I don't need to know in super detail so 
                I can move on to the actual meat and potatoes of the book. It's week 3 technically man...
