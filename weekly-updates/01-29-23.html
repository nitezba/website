            <p>First week of the semester! A mixed start but I'm feeling phenomenal to be honest. Embarrassed by the fact that I literally had shit lingering from last semester taking time away from my present day.
                Feels way too reminiscent of last semester which was arguably my worst yet, in terms of how I did academically and overall just how every day felt like a chore. Even so, this week was the opposite 
                and I'm proud of myself for being the change I want to see. I'm journaling consistently, and effortlessly which is an important adjective. <a href="https://youtu.be/iEIqVq7EZqE?list=PL1gOzFOzzaL354WA_OnPwe8SQ_CMTemln">Today is today</a>.                 
            </p>
            <p>Two things on my mind this week are a sort of "dopamine detox" and being nice to yourself, both thanks to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL38uJEf-kRca5bpzK8HpQNt-r3znXUG1y">Man of Action</a> series.
                Yes this is a little close to bullshit sigma male tropes, yes this man tells you with a straight face to turn into an apex predator in your daily life. Filtering through that stuff, I still think this is 
                very valuable. Side note, listening to this podcast has made the treadmill (i.e. the most boring workout ever conceived by mankind) actually interesting as the time goes by much faster without fully distracting 
                me from focusing on actually running. Actually before I talk about that MoA stuff then... 
            </p>
            <center><h3>Exercise</h3></center>
            <p>I absolutely want to stick to working out on a consistent basis. The universe keeps pointing me in the direction of lifting too. I've been seeing that a lot recently, "the universe telling me to do shit" - main 
                example of that this week was sitting in on the Complex Variables class and I'm glad that coincidence came to be. In any case, I didn't track my workouts properly, but I ran twice, swam on Sunday, and did abs once 
                I believe. 
            </p>

            <p>This is getting finished in the wrong week so I'd like to wrap it up. The basic gist of the MoA stuff is that you can help yourself enjoy difficult tasks that you <em>want</em> to do by reducing your exposure to really high 
            spikes of dopamine elsewhere. The idea is that it's hard to let go of activities that give your brain constant, high spikes in dopamine (scrolling instagram for example); reducing exposure to them can increase your appreciation 
            for equally enjoyable things that just require a little more effort. With regards to being nice to yourself - well that's it. 
            </p>
            <p>Quick speedrun of the week academically: brief category theory intro in Fields & Modules, something something Euler Characteristic and classification of surfaces (homeomorphic to a sphere, sum of tori, or sum of projective planes).
