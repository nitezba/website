                <b>Good summaries take time.</b> I started on the Dummit and Foote part of this <a href="../blogs/thoughts1.html"> on Wednesday</a> and three days of work
                yielded what I have down there for it, which is barely even two sections. Working through it will be good practice for condensing my thoughts and communicating 
                them, both of which are skills I want to develop. But if two sections of material I should already know took as long as they did I can't help 
                but wonder if I need to rethink the chapter/week approach I chose to take with this book. On the other hand, the early content of Munkres isn't 
                particularly advanced, the "read -> close book & summarize -> reread" approach kept it engaging and productive. On the other side of things, 
                I didn't really hold myself to my other proposed metric of doing assigned homework problems. I'm having a hard time pinpointing why too; maybe it's a matter
                of starting earlier, or posting solutions here (which I obviously haven't done this week ahhhhh). Frustration gets the better of me much faster
                that I'd like it to. I can't even commit to getting it in this weekend because of a vacation.
                <br>
                <b>What can I improve upon this week?</b> Well again, that vacation is going to get in the way, but in general I think I need to stop worrying about speeding through 
                material, whether I know it already or not. In doing so, I think I'm setting myself up for failure when I inevitably end up going slow on a problem or take a lot of time 
                trying ot understand something. With that in mind, I'll spend this week trying to enjoy the material more than trying to condense it.

                <br>
                
                With TIT I'm probably gonna try and focus on condensing and explaining big ideas rather than "$(ab)^{-1} = b^{-1}a^{-1}$ is a thing that is true in a group now learn it". 
    
                Also this log on chapter one of D&F was obscenely long and that definitely won't scale well - I think this one <em>needed</em> to be long since it's moreso me proving that I know the material as opposed to summarizing 
                learning, but they absolutely have to be shorter in the future.

            <p> Coming soon: <a href="">Motivational History of Group Theory</a>; alternatively, "wait this is a really random definition..."
                <br>
                A group is a set $G$ that abides by certain properties. This is what I see in my head when I need to think about a group:
            </p>
                <img src="../images/group.png" class="text-img">
            <p>
                Call it my version of a mnemonic. Early on, the first step to understanding a group is to actually <em>remember</em> its properties  
                (I confess to having given this too much thought, the picture keeps it simple for me). In order for a set to be a group, we first need a <b>binary operator</b>
                (also known as a law of composition) to act on its elements. Formally, this is a map $+:G \times G \to G$; and example is $+(a,b) = c$. 
                This is just a rule that answers "what happens when we take element $a$ and mash is with element $b$?", or simply, $a+b = c$.
                So, if this map/binary operator/law of composition/operation has four golden properties, we call it a <b>group</b>:
                <ol>
                    <li>Closure - the operation will always yield another element of the set</li>
                    <li>Associativity - parenthesize at will!</li>
                    <li>Identity - there is some element of $G$ such that operating on it with any other element will yield that other element</li>
                    <li>Inverses - for every element of $G$, there is another (<em>not necessarily distinct</em>) element such that operating on the two yields that special identity element from before</li>
                </ol>
                Boom. You know what group is. You probably feel like it's a very arbitrary and maybe even random set of things to define, but the motivation
                and importance comes with a bit of time.
            </p>
                <hr>
            <p>
                A motivating example of a group is <b>the dihedral group</b>. The general definition is that it is the group of symmetries of a regular n-gon. Too un-jargon this, let's think about a pentagon.
                First though, let's think a little more formally about symmetry. Normally we probably think about symmetry in the context of "this shape is symmetric because if I move it around
                in $x$ or $y$ way, I can still get a shape that looks the same." To add some rigor, note that in order for a translation of the shape to be valid, adjacent vertices must stay adjacent.
                This is inherently tied to the idea of a line of symmetry.
                
            </p>
            <div>
                <img src="../images/pentagon.png" style="max-width: 50%; float: left; padding-inline: 13px;" class="text-img">
                <p> Here if we <em>rotate</em> the pentagon such that all vertices fall on the location of previous vertices, we essentially have the same shape (this is a rotation by $\frac{360}{5} = 72$ degrees).
                    If we do this three more times, we get all the distinct variations of the pentagon that preserve adjacent pairs before landing on where we started (remember this). This isn't enough though! 
                    If the image here can be written as $ABCDE$, then what about $AEDCB$? It preserves pairs like before, but isn't obtained through any rotation; hence we consider <em>reflections</em> as well. Now we can start to see a 
                    bit of the group structure that emerges naturally. Remember how rotating a certain number of times (5 in this case) puts the shape back at where it started - the same is true of reflecting 
                    it across the same axis twice. Look back at the group axioms from earlier and see if you can identify how this might be of importance to us.

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    ...
                    <br>
                </p>
                <p> What you probably should've thought first was "wait don't we need some kind of operation first before we can think about a group" and you're right! But we already kinda have it; the only thing missing
                    is to observe that <em>composing</em> rotations and reflections is this operation. Note that it's not the act of applying the symmetries onto the polygon, but rather doing one after the other 
                    that gives us an operation - which you should decide for yourself is closed. To make that last bit easier, we can start to abstract away a bit: call the rotation of the pentagon $\rho$ and the reflection 
                    $\tau$. These can now be treated as <em>elements of a set</em> rather than translations of a shape. And they're special ones at that since they're going to <em>generate</em> the rest of our set.
                    (Sidenote: this guarantees closure). We said before

                    <li>Relations are sets. Given a set $X$ and a relation $R$ on $X$, for a given $x \in X$, $R \subseteq X \times X$ is the set of all elements of
                        $X \times X$ such that $xRy$ (i.e. $x$ is in the $R$ relation to $y$).
                    </li>
                    <li>Given a relation, if it has three special properties (reflexivity, symmetry, and the transitive property) we call it an equivalence relation.
                        This is usually given by ~ instead of $R$ though it can be read the same.
                    </li>
                    <li>Similarly, if it has anti-reflexivity, the transitive property, and either $xRy$ or $yRx$ we call it an order relation (typically given by $<$).</li>
                    <li>Two important indexing sets are $\{1, \dots, m\}$ and $\mathbb{Z}^+$. The idea of indexing sets (along with m-tuples) helps define a more general notion
                        of the cartesian product, though I'm not entirely sure how this works just yet.

            <p>A quickie here but I'm playing tennis more consistently and when I'm obliged to play slower tennis I'm forcing myself to learn 
                to come to the net for once in my life. <em>I think</em> a pattern that works is to, at some point in the rally 1) find the chance for 
                a down the line groundstroke (preferably wrong-footing them) 2) if the ball is even mildly short, rush in with a cross court approach and 3) 
                get there <b>in ready position</b> to finish. My problem is that I stop being mindful/intense about midway through this and 
                by the time I get to the net I'm not ready for the volley. I've only realized this as I've tried to force myself into this lately, 
                but down the line approach shots are probably not the move because it leaves the easier cross-court angle open for passing shots. By
                approaching with a cross court shot, you force the opponent to try and pass you down the line, which is obviously harder.
