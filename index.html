            <h2>Hey!</h2>
            <p>
            I'm currently an undergrad at Lehigh University. My academic interests are mathematics and computer science, 
            with a long term goal of attending grad school (likely to keep studying math). At the moment, I'm focused on 
            learning how to learn independently, with the hope that I can 1) transfer those skills to all parts of my life and 
            2) get a better idea of what kind of math I'd like to specialize in. Along this journey, I like to <a href="books.html">read</a>, I 
            (try to) keep up a high level of tennis, and I maintain a strong belief in the power of journaling, 
            which I apply through <a href="blogs-home.html">this blog.</a>

            <br>
            <br>

            Also talk to me about <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/sass_chan" target="_blank">music</a> whenever, I have many opinions.
