            <p>Week two of the semester and we already had our first all-nighter. Sigh. I can already see myself getting stuck in a similar loop as last semester.
                I had one week where I started my homework late, so I stayed up really late finishing, got everything in on time except for Algebra since I can use
                corrections, and then I'm way too tired in the tail end of the week to get ahead on the next stuff. Combined with the fact that I was home this past weekend,
                as well as a certain individual occupying a good deal of mental space - well I write this on the bus home having not really started my 10 algebra questions due 
                tomorrow. I did it this past week for Algebraic Topology, I'll do it again tonight if I need to. We do what we must. I'm actually really proud of the fact 
                that I did that Algebraic Topology homework almost without googling things and stayed up without an energy drink. Sheer willpower kept me going and it 
                did so until <a target="_blank" href="">the job was finished</a>. 
            </p>
            <center><h3>Exercise</h3></center>
            <p>Still going strong this week! A dumbbell workout got my arms really sore and 2.5 miles on Friday got an insane amount of adrenaline pumping 
                through my veins. Also even after that Algebraic Topology late night grind I still got my ass to the spin class on Tuesday for the cardio. Not the best
                workout but I fuckin did it. It's just what we do!!! This week I plan on taking advantage of my more able-bodied friends to help me gauge how much I can 
                bench, squat, and deadlift. I'm taking the weekly progress pictures too - I know this shit will only really show 2-3 months from now but I'm still making sure 
                these first steps are in the direction of who I want to be. Or rather, who I am.
            </p>
            <center><h3>Math</h3></center>
            <p>This week I had the idea to make "formal" summaries of my weeks in math part of these summaries. Although I'd still like to follow through on that idea, 
                my level of understanding of most of the material I learned this week is simply not there yet. In order to be able to give this the attention it needs and make detailed 
                summaries, I need to start homework on Thursday so that I'm not overwhelmed over the weekend by built up things. This week is another chance to reset.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        A module is a generalized vector space. A vector space is an abelian group (the vectors) along with a field of scalars, and they communicate by scalar multiplication.
                        A module is that but with a ring providing the scalars instead.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Homeomorphic surfaces have isomorphic fundamental groups.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>A note about my first paragraph - my awareness of my situation is by no means a deterrent to my determination to straighten the ship. I'm already doing so much better
                than last semester and I know that with a few consecutive good days of work I can subdue this monster semester I'm taking on. 
            </p>
            <p>Resonance. I spoke before about the need for balancing what I want, which is discovered by simply digging deep within oneself, and what I should do, which is external pressure.
                There is another component: what my circumstances allow me to. In all actions that I try to get something out of, I need to make a creative plan that <b>resonates</b> with me 
                in all three of these aspects.
