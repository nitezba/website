        <h2>June 4th, 2022 - Weekly Summary #1</h2>
        <p>Week 1 is more like week 0.5, but a habit is a habit and practice it demands. <b>What did I accomplish this week?</b>
        I started my week with the conviction of doing every problem in Artin, but after seeing that Chapter 2 alone contains 101 problems, 
        and considering how slow I moved through some Chapter 1 problems earlier in the week, I decided that it was an unrealistic usage of my time.
        Now, was this the right decision? Who fuckin knows!! Future me probably does but he's not time travelling back anytime soon with any advice.
        Thanks to <em>Ultralearning</em> though (I read the chapters on Metalearning and Focus this week), I realized that before embarking on any major 
        commitments - especially ones that might involve difficulty - I need to have the <em>why, what, and how</em> answered. I did not have the most 
        important one, <em>why?</em> answered for my idea to just do every problem in Artin. Why did I wanna do that? It was partially an impulse, seeing
        <a href="https://github.com/UlisseMini/understanding-analysis-solutions">others do it</a>. But besides that I put no thought into the decison,
        besides vaguely thinking it would be a straightforward way to get what I want with Algebra this summer.

        <br>
        <br>
        
        About that - what do I want with Algebra this summer? I've been saying to myself that I want to review material from the semeter, and then push that
        knowledge further in an attempt to prepare for my next Algebra class. When worded that way then, my focus shouldn't necessarily be devoted to 
        figuring out how to study <em>exclusively</em> out of a textbook; <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/">other materials exist</a> and ultimately, what I want
        is to learn. That being said, being able to commit to and consume a textbook is a skill I want to learn, so these two things can go hand in hand,
        but I see no reason to limit myself. In any case, I can divide up Algebra into shit I know and want to review and shit I just don't know.
        I want my focus to be on shit I don't know, so it makes sense that I can spend less time on the reviewing to make time for new shit. I'm veering off now
        into <b>shit I wanna do next week</b>, so let's get back on track for a moment before getting more specific there.
        <br>
        <br>

        Wait that's kinda most of what I did this week oops. Besides committing to this and setting up <strike>other stuff</strike> (I need to avoid vague language in these)
        what I wanna do with blogs here, I did some "research" into <a>how to read textbooks</a>. Kinda goes against what I just said, but textbooks are unavoidable
        so it will be applied.

        <br>
        <br>

        Okay for real now, <b>what do I want to accomplish this coming week?</b> Hey if I make like an actual list of things to post here I can hold myself
        accountable next week (something I've not really done with my daily journals). So, my most pressing task is definitely to create/decide upon a firm 
        plan of attack for what I want to do this summer. What do I wanna do? As I've said review and push forward in Algebra. What does "plan of attack" imply though?
        The system with which I want to achieve that omnipresent goal of learning. Alright so tl;dr on that bit, I want to have an explicit system statement 
        <em>with an actual why? answer</em> in the hope that when momenets of doubt inevitably present themselves to it, I will have this solid foundation to keep me on track.
        This, however, is only half of TIT - I worry of getting bored of only a single topic so I'd like to take up either Differential Geometry or Lie Algebras
        as well. IMPORTANTLY, this should really only take a day of work/planning. This being the first log, I don't have anything to update on from the previous 
        week so I'm okay with keeping this part less involved, but Monday definitely needs to be the starting point of whatever plans I set out on Sunday.
