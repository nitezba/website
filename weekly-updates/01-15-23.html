            <p>This is coming in on Monday, I had a busy-ish weekend. The timing works out better this week though - as I write this, Chloe is sitting on my lap for the last time. She's keeping me warm for 
                the last time, she's purring as I scratch her neck for the last time, diggin her nails into my leg for the last time, biting my nose for the last time. What hurts me the most is that she has no idea.
                She has absolutely no clue that her last few hours on this fucking earth are nigh, and she won't know it in the car on her way to the vet, or in her little Jetblue bag as we carry her in, or probably 
                even as she gets whatever fucking shot it is that is gonna finally put her to sleep. Who the fuck am I to say "this creature shall no longer live", who gave anyone the right, that kind of power over
                another living, breathing, feeling animal, much less one that has absolutely no form of freewill to scream out "NOT YET!! PLEASE!!"  
            </p>
            <p> I'm definitely being selfish to some extent. All the times I've neglected her, I've been lazy in changing her litterbox, I've chosen not to play with her for whatever inconsequential reason - 
                none of that is coming back. There is no second chance, there is no "ahorita le doy atencion". Am I ungrateful for not being satisfied with the 12 years of unconditional joy she has given me?
            </p>
            <p> She's stitting at her pedestal by the window now. Como siempre en su aquario. I'm inclined to beg for another postponement to the appointment but I don't know if that would do anything. Perhaps I'm 
                just dragging out a goodbye that should really be more like ripping of a bandaid. Perhaps I'm trying to make up for all the small times I've neglected her, fully well knowing that it's very late for 
                any of that. 
            </p>
            <p> This isn't really a sumary of my week anymore but I don't really care, this is what is important to me at this juncture in time. I had a mundane week. A wake, a funeral, family only by blood.
                What do you even do with someone you know you're never going to see again? I don't know if it's better to be spared the awareness of that level of finality or to know about it and act 
                "accordingly". But I don't think there is any "accordingly", 2023 has already shown me the death fucks people up in strange ways. 

            </p>
            <p>I just had the words to describe this feeling but they escape me know. Something along the lines of knowing that life must continue without someone that has been a constant in life until this point. 
                I wanted to record her purring one more time, but I guess it's most typical and fitting that she instead bit me and started playing. Los ultimos tamales que me regalo entonces fue aqui en mi mesa, sentada 
                en mi pierna izquierda mientras le acarciaba el cuello como siempe. Hasta luego, mi nina ermosa, my bolita de pelo, mi perra inmunda, mi gata voladora, mi Chloe. 

            </p>

            <p> I did those 50 sit ups 5/7 mornings, I can do 75 instead this week. Chloe has brought to light my biggest fear - wishing I could've done more by the time nothing can be done. I would like to remember that 
                feeling for a very long time.
