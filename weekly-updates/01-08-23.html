            <p> During a Moment of Weakness around Halloween last year I described the pillars of my existence (vaguely) as studying, tennis, fitness, and, well... one more.
                At least while I get back into the rhythm of this, that's probably a good frame to start with.
            </p>
            <center><h2>"Studying"</h2></center>
            <p>I don't think that's the right word for it actually. "Academic pursuits" seems more appropriate but I also kinda don't like phrasing it like that either. For now 
                it's at least not of terribly great importance since I didn't do much of it. My main goal for this week was fairly easy - just get the frame of this website set 
                up - and I did at least accomplish that much. But there's a lot more things I feel like like I should be doing: preparing for the semester (Alg. Topology, Fields & 
                Modules, Number Theory) and time is running short. This serves as a good transition into something that has been on my mind all year though.
            </p>
            <center><h3><a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5Lgl33kSZNzPuJ3glvBixw?si=c6e9a97277b54255" target="_blank">Want vs. Should</a></h3></center>
            <p> I came across this podcast courtesy of good ol' Thomas Randall (aka Randy). It occurred to me to just check up on what he was doing since I hadn't gotten a newsletter 
                in a while and in one of his last blogs he mentioned the podcast. The general idea (to me) has been this: "should" is a toxic word that makes of think of desires as 
                expectations, and in a way fosters a negative feeling towards them. The podcast does a better job explaining this but it highly resonated with me. I've spent the better 
                part of my time self-studying doing so because it felt like I <em>should</em> be doing it. We're not gonna take this all the way, otherwise we'll end up wondering 
                if that's the only reason I feel like I enjoy math. In any case I do think there is some truth to it (at least for me). I would like to cut the word out of my 
                vocabulary and at least see what comes of it. The same goes for "ahorita". My problem is the following though: the immediate solution to the problem of shoulds is 
                to follow your wants. For example, all the games and books in my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nkgAlnDIPMU" target="_blank">backlog</a> aren't shoulds, 
                they were added to the list because I <em>want</em> to enjoy them, and it is only when I start to think that I should be playing/reading them that it turns into a 
                responsibility I impose on myself and start to resent until I just feel "eh" towards it. Additionally, at the root of most of our behaviors is a want. I want to eat 
                because I am hungry (or bored), I want to scroll Instagram because it is an immediately satisfying use of two minutes, I want to watch Dragon Ball because Krillin is 
                fucking stupid for chasing the android p- I mean because of the inherent enjoyment I get from it. The podcast mentions the idea of tracing our wants as far back as possible
                and that if you can trace them back far enough to a "want that you don't actually want", then you'll naturally make the right choice. If I'm procrastinating a task,
                I can trace back the want of a different activity, to a want of immediate satisfaction, to a want of some kind of "small success", then realize that what I <em>really</em> want is the 
                resolution of the task I'm procrastinating, and then go back to doing it and make the right in-the-moment decision. The problem with a reliance on want is that difficult
                things are hard to want. When I'm doing a plank, I don't want to feel pain, my immediate reaction is to let the plank go. I guess you could argue that the deeper want of 
                gaining strength would override the immediate want to give up (surrender is an outcome far worse than defeat) but that kind of thought process doesn't occur for me 
                automatically. Not yet at least - part of cutting out the s-word is to force myself to practice thinking in terms of what I really want when I do something. Another example
                I've lived this week is that I <em>want</em> to play Sekiro - and so I play Sekiro instead of pursuing other things that I know will contribute to my sanity later on. This last 
                bit is what I really mean, listening to easy wants is much easier than listening to more challenging wants, so this practice can't be taken at purely face value. The last thing 
                the podcast mentioned that stuck out to me though was to practice 30 minutes in the morning of just asking "who do I want to be in myself today" and I think I stand to 
                gain from a morning routine like that. I have more to say on this, but I'd like more time to put it into practice and see what benefits and downsides come of it. On topic 
                of a morning routine though... 
            </p>
            <center><h2>Exercise & Tennis</h2></center>
            <p> I've kinda just been freestyling what I wanna do. I guess that lines up pretty well with that last bit but it's also not enough to get into the shape that I <b>want.</b>
                I had a really fun bike ride, I've played a good bit more tennis, going so far as to play a total of five hours this past Wednesday. That was actually so much fun, I saw Walter 
                in the morning to hit, then hitting in with the kids at the club, and then staying an extra hour to hit in for a private. I almost passed out in that last hour but I remembered 
                Ippo refusing to collapse in the ring and I pushed through. It's insane how much motivation and good energy I've received from anime. From Goku and Vegeta training in the 
                gravity chamber to Ippo catching those leaves, it's just so fucking inspirational. I love that shit dawg.
            </p>
            <center><h3>This week tho</h3></center>
            <p>I wanna do 50 sit ups every morning. Is this the most thought out plan? No. But it is action. I don't need to plan out in thorough detail everything. Once I'm in the habit of
                doing exercise in the morning then maybe but right now I just want to DO.
            </p>
            <center><h2>Life</h2></center>
            <p>Death has been very present this first week. Chloe's tumor is fucking disgusting her days are numbered. I'm convinced she has more fight in her but I'm told it's selfish 
                of me to put her through that kind of pain. I do not know. My step-grandfather passed away on Friday the 6th. The emptiness in that room was terrifying. Death still scares me, and 
                seeing the empty shell of a human simply laying, inert and cold - it unsettled me. As my uncle said though: "This is life." Also in the intro to a book, coincidentally about wants vs. shoulds,
                the author's father died from slipping on ice. Something as simple as that. It shook me in the moment, but none of these things really stick...
