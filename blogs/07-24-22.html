            <p>I'll spitball a bit. I tried another jam this week but didn't really give it the intense attention it deserves. Didn't wake up at least one 
                day for the early hit. Hell I didn't even work out for 3 of the 7 days. I did get the chance to play some solid tennis at a club I once called home 
                and that nostalgia definitely made my week. A decent chunk of me still feels like summer of 2019 was peak - my tennis was at it's best, I had nothing 
                academic or life-altering to worry about and socially I was just very happy. Let's not get carried away though. This week I really felt the need for a 
                fixed, well-defined schedule and it's a combination of reasons.
                <ul>
                    <li>I spend a lot of time on things that I could definitely get done in a shorter amount of time if I had a plan. A prime example is organizing code.
                        That shit shouldn't take a full work session, and yet it happens.
                    </li>
                    <li>Similarly, I sit down to do something (like plan out my week) and get distracted with a million and one possible things. Ideally having a preplanned 
                        time slot as well as a box to check off would discourage procrastination.
                    </li>
                    <li>Ambivalence about what to do with a study session; would definitely save time to have some decisions made ahead of time.</li>
                    <li>A lax attitude towards starting late - there are days when I waste time in the morning for literally no reason, and a mild sense of urgency to 
                        get the day started would go a long way to eliminating that. If it was actually chill time I'd be fine with it but it's not even that it's just no thoughts 
                        head empty time.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                Also about that "planning more math" stuff. Again with the need for a schedule, but yeah I never actually sat down and gave it enough time.
                This might not be the best week to start anyways since half of it is deleted anyways (DC trip!) but at a bare glance, a survey of Algebraic Topology 
                seems like a good first choice. All I really gotta do then is pick out big ideas and make a loose outline of when I wanna do them and how.

            <p>Okay. A closed set is the complement of an open set. Simple as that. Take $(0,1) \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, it's complement is $(-\infty, 0] \cup [1, \infty)$.
                That is a closed set. These things can be used to define a topology on a set just like we did with open sets actually, though in my head it feels a bit weird cuz 
                you need a topology to already exist to have the idea of a closed set (with this definition at least). So, given a topological space, arbitrary intersections of closed
                sets are closed, as well as finite unions. I think interior/closure is usually talked about for <em>subspaces</em> so I'll answer for that - the interior of a subspace 
                is the union of open sets <em>contained within</em> the subspace. Closure is the intersection of all closed sets <em>containing</em> the subspace. Closure is more talked 
                about and important than interior but I don't have a full picture of why just yet. <b>I need to keep an eye out for the answer to this as I keep reading.</b>
            </p>
            <p>Ok but all this talk of complements of open sets is a bit annoying - we can also define the closure of a set as the union of the set with all its <b>limit points.</b>
               Intuitively, the limit point of a set is one that is either in the set, or infinitely close to it. IIRC the formal definition is that it's a point such that every open set around it
               (i.e. every <b>neighborhood</b> around the point) intersects the set. That's why 0 is a limit point of (0,1).
            </p>
            <p>A <b>Hausdorff space</b> is a topological space where every pair of points is contained in some disjoint neighborhood. The consequence of this is that <b>point sets
                become closed.</b> It is apparently wacky and unfun to try and make classifications of topological spaces that don't have this property, so we might work within its constraint 
                later on. How does that condition accomplish that though? A weaker version of this is the $T_1$ axiom, which actually just states that consequence of the Hausdorff condition - that point sets are closed. This is weaker than the 
                Hausdorff condition though and I still need to really understand why.
            </p>
            <p>Speaking of things I still need to sit down and truly understand - <b>how is the epsilon-delta definition of continuity I know and love from analysis the same as the general definition?</b>
                That definition being: a continuous function $f: X \to Y$ is one where the preimage of open sets in $Y$ are open in $X$. Intuitively I think this can just be thought of as "open sets map
                to open sets" but formally, that condition is actually not equivalent (and probably weaker) than stating it with the preimage. Example I remember is mapping all of R to 0 - it's clearly continuous 
                but every open set in R maps to a point set, which is not open. This also makes it clear that continuity really depends on the topologies of the domain and codomain. 
            </p>
            <p>Ok this is where I left off - three equivalent definitions of continuity. The first one is that the image of each closure of all subset is a subset of the closure of the image ($f(\overline{A}) \subseteq \overline{f(A)})$.
                I can actually see the equivalence with the original definition here - and I can't remember it... at least I know I need to review :/ Another definition is that the preimage of closed sets are closed, but that's about where 
                I left off. I also read the homeomorphisms are the same idea as isomorphisms from algebra so we're getting to the "classifying" part of things.

                Good week ahead, albeit somewhat short.
