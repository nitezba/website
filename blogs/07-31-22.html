            <p> As I said last week, this was always gonna be a slow week because of a trip to D.C. </p>

            <p>Fun trip! Would definitely go back with more time, both to actually go to museums and to be able to spend more time with certain friends :)
                The changing of the guard at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier was definitely a highlight though. Definitely one of the most solemn and affairs I've ever 
                witnessed. I'm not the most patriotic person, but at that moment, seeing the respect, precision, and dignity with which those men carried out 
                their "menial" task of walking back and forth in front of tomb - it made me appreciate the significance and pride that comes with serving your country.

                Completely unrelated - I'm sitting at the park writing this right now, and birds opening their mouths to feed each other made me smile.
            </p>
            <p>Also another thought, but I'm feeling very dependent of my phone lately, and I think it has to do with the overall restlessness I've had. By that I mean just 
                the constant craving of "something to do" which isn't entirely bad? but I don't like the easy avenues of instant gratification that it leads me down. Quiet moments 
                are an absolute necessity and would probably honestly help with comprehension and clarity in what I'm studying.
            </p>
            <p>
                Last random thing floating around my head is a fucking Liver King video of all things. Basically, if you're looking for a "favorite workout" you're doing something 
                wrong. Exercise is literally destroying your body so that it builds itself back better - look for the things that will push your body the hardest and thus 
                bring you the most improvement. Embrace monotony and suffering. It just was something that popped up in my mind as I was in the gym on Thursday doing legs; 
                it genuinely got me to push harder so it's at least worth remembering.

                This concludes the Gains™ part of the week.

                Anyways.

                Scheduling most definitely gave me a sense of urgency and purpose for the two days where I actually applied it. It got my ass out of bed to workout, it got 
                me to save some time in the morning with dumb shit, and just overall felt good to be doing things at times when I planned them. Will repeat and compound on that this week.

                Besides that I don't really have much to talk about study-wise though. For the ~different~ math that I plan on studying I'm just going to use the book on Fractals and Topology 
                I've been sitting on. It looks interesting and actually readable, and uses some of the topology I've learned. Actually it's relatively short so I should be able to finish it before
                the semester starts. I'll draft up a plan for that today - maybe I can speedrun the whole thing in a day (surface level obviously) and leave behind questions that can inform the next 
                three weeks. I'll do that tonight (I'm actually doing this on Sunday!! yee haw!!).
