        <h2>What I'm working on: </h2>
        <p>Right now I'm kind of busy being a waste of space but I'm getting bored of that so...</p> 
        
        <ul>
            <li>I'll be picking up Artin's <em>Algebra</em> soon. <strike>I'll try</strike> I will write up my work/solutions to all the problems I do <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/read/nkhvfpwwwrxs">here</a>.</li>
        </ul>

        
        <h2>What I'd like to work on: </h2>
        <p>As it stands my long term goal is grad school but I don't really know what I'd do once I'd get there (as in, what category I might like to stick to). Algebra has been fun, hence I'd like to keep doing some stuff there - based on my limited view of things plus light guidance from professors... </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Erdmann and Wildon's <em>Introduction to Lie Algebras</em>.</li>
            <li>Abbott's <em>Understanding Analysis</em> - finishing my first undergrad anal class was cool and all but both the class and my understanding of the material left much to be desired.</li>
            <li>do Carmo's <em>Differential Geometry of Curves and Surfaces</em> - some independent study with a Professor put this book in my lap and I'd like to learn it!</li>
            <li>Number theory question mark? - from a distance everything here looks really cool but I've yet to sink my teeth into it in any way shape or form.</li>
            <li>i ummm i uhhh ummm i uhhhhh...</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What's standing in my way: </h2>
        <p>This will likely turn into a blog/blog post eventually but I do have at least some of my personal roadblocks identified:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Two seconds of bravery</b> - I procrastinate. A lot. This ties in to the next bullet but my theory is that I default to "taking advantage" of my free time to do shit I can't do when I'm busy (such as during the semester)
                so then when I do have a lot of time (like I do now) it gets wasted very easily <em>in spite of the fact that there are productive things I know I'd rather be doing</em>.</li>
            <li><b>Perceived difficulty</b> - Math is hard lol, and moreso when it's done in near-isolation. I have a hard time getting started/sticking to things that are hard without a professor there.</li>
            <li><b>Committment</b> - I have an easy enough time (usually) sticking to a lecture series or taking notes but one of the self-study conundrums I've yet to crack is how to get myself to do problems outside the context of homework. This is likely just a mental issue of being lazy but it exists nonetheless.</li>    
        </ul>
        <h2>What do I plan to do about it: </h2>
        <p>Again, this discussion will likely be part of a blog/blogpost but at the moment my only plan is to follow the <em>Atomic Habits</em> strategy of daily 1% gains. Even on days where laziness is the dominating feeling or days filled with errands, there is something productive to be gleaned from every day.
        A major helping hand to this comes in the form of *drum roll*... the Pomodoro Technique! which I will be using abundantly to measure progress/productivity on tasks.</p>
