        <div id="meta">
            <p>A month has passed - a look back on what I've "accomplished" is in order. In all honesty it feels like very little. I didn't stick with Dummit
                and Foote besides some of the problems, and even then I only did those recently. I have stuck with Munkres but it's been so much slower than I 
                would've hoped. I'm only on chapter 2 and not even a significant enough amount into it to justify my place in the book right now. Honestly it saddens 
                me because even though it feels like I have been putting in work, I know it could be more intense. Yes, I go to the library and study frequently,
                but some days it takes me an hour to even get started studying, Some days I come home after just two hours and find myself unable to start focusing again. 
                Some days I also twist my ankle. <em>What have I accomplished in a month?</em> My "why" for even trying any of this has been "learning how to learn 
                from a textbook" and really just learning how to learn in general. Have I really even done that so far though? I keep asking because I don't want 
                to just say "yes" and then arrive at some contrived justification for that yes, I want to actually believe in my answer. By any metric I can't really say 
                yes and feel comfortable with it unfortunately. There has been a positive though: <b>SDL</b>. 
            </p>
            <p>
                On a whim I kind of decided to try my hand at making a game. The one thing I can absolutely say I've gained at least is a much better awareness 
                and understanding for the need of being 100% clear with myself on what I want and a plan of attack (even if I haven't been as disciplined as I'd like). 
                I've just been direct with it: I wanna replicate small games using only the docs and googling as my tools. It's been a little slow, but importantly <b>it's been fun</b>.
                I enjoy trying to piece together things by myself using just the documentation and then realizing I actually got it right. And I want to try and apply that same 
                feeling of discovery and curiosity to studying math because I know it's there, it just gets overshadowed by, you guessed it: frustration...
            </p>
        
            <p>
                The best way I've thought of to translate that feeling to reading a textbook is a more organized way of 
                <ol>
                    <li>Read an entire chapter (or big chunk) on Monday. The aim here isn't to create comprehension right away, but rather to leave behind a breadcrumb trail of 
                        questions to fill in throughout the week, and answer as a test at the end of the week.
                    </li>
                    <li>On the same day, make a detailed plan of attack for the rest of the week with concrete benchmarks.
                    </li> 
                    <li>Read according to that plan, preferably with the read + recall method.</li>
                    <li>Test!</li>
                </ol>
            </p>

            <p>The idea behind this is to try and incorporate more free recall into the studying, which is hard but is also part of the fun I've rediscovered in SDL. 
                The only "problem" with free recall is the that in order to recall something you have to be presented with it first, hence the Monday speedrun.
            </p>
            <p>The plan for this week then is to make that work on part of, if not all of Chapter 2 of Munkres. Given my track record, the entire chapter is ambitious but I'll set a solid goal as I read on Monday.
                In between I'll keep doing game stuff for the sheer fun of it :) AND algebra problems because with that I'm okay with just doing problems at the moment. I gotta spruce this place up a bit tbh.

            <h3 class="center">Sleep</h3>
            <p> My sleep has been a little fucked lately. Just acknowledging that. I wanna start getting the sleep train going by 10:30 this week so I can 
                wake up early and either workout, play tennis, or read. Speaking of which...
            </p>
            <h3 class="center">Exercise</h3>
            <p> I still have my resolution of being able to do 100 consecutive push ups by the end of the year. I did my morning ones again this week and got to 30.
                Dealing with a twisted ankle again was/is extremely silly but I don't want to let it deter me. I'll play tennis again this week and I'll work out every morning.
