            <p>There are many kinds of media that I value and find meaning in. For the most part though, they are video games,
                movies, music, and books. This page is my collection of all the media I have at some point found interesting enough 
                to make note of. This isn't necessarily a list plan to fully exhaust, but as I slowly experience everything on here,
                I'll write down my thoughts and link them appropriately. These also aren't necessarily recommendations, as those will 
                be found elsewhere on this site.
            </p>

            <p>It should be noted that my <a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/wishlist/profiles/76561199024235368/#sort=name">Steam wishlist and library</a> also serves as a pretty good indicator of what I'm interested in 
                and what I enjoy. The list below combines everything on that list (included mostly for the sake of completion) as well as games 
                I've stumbled upon and just made mental notes of. I've amassed this list from many different places, but when I deem it appropriate,
                I'll make a brief note of why it has its place on this list or a short summary of what it is.

            <!-- options here are:
            - just a list and link if i play
            - only list things i havent played and make a different list, which will look much nicer, containing games i have played along with my opinions of them
            - make this look slightly prettier
            - categorize them by genre or something else
